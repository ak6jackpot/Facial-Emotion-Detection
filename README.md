# Facial-Emotion-Detection
Facial emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. People vary widely in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively nascent research area. Generally, the technology works best if it uses multiple modalities in context. To date, the most work has been conducted on automating the recognition of facial expressions from video and photos.
Decades of scientific research have been conducted developing and evaluating methods for automated emotion recognition. There is now an extensive literature proposing and evaluating hundreds of different kinds of methods, holding techniques from multiple areas, such as signal processing, machine learning, computer vision, and speech processing.
We used two approaches to detect the subject's emotion: emotion detection using facial landmarks and emotion detection using EEG signals.
